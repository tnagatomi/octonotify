# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Open a private security advisory on GitHub (recommended), or
- Contact the repository owner directly

Please include:

- A description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions/commit SHA
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and work with you on a responsible disclosure timeline.
